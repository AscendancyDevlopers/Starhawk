28/03/2025 01:18:06,Yes,communistghost,Yes,Hutchs Robert Von Monarch,34,Male,Portus Region,Visus Primus Region,Administrative,,"Born into poverty in the rugged outskirts of Portus, Robert grew up in a tight-knit community where survival depended on cooperation and resilience. From a young age, he understood the weight of responsibility—not just for himself, but for those around him. While others saw hardship as an unbreakable cycle, Robert saw an opportunity to change fate.

Diligent and sharp-minded, he excelled in school, earning a reputation for his meticulous organization, punctuality, and an uncanny ability to solve problems under pressure. By the time he reached eighteen, he had become a pillar of his community—trusted, respected, and known for his kindness and unwavering empathy. His people saw in him what he had long believed himself: the potential to be a force for change.

Pooling their meager resources, his family and neighbors made a collective sacrifice, sending Robert to the capital to study political and administrative sciences at the nation’s most prestigious university. Aware of the weight of their expectations, he threw himself into his studies with relentless determination, graduating with distinction.

Returning home, he took his first steps in governance as a local clerk, quickly proving his worth within the regional administration. His rise was swift—his sharp mind and deep-rooted sense of duty caught the attention of the Oversight Council, who saw in him not just a skilled administrator, but a leader. When he was called to serve in the Parliamentary Office, he accepted with one unshakable vow: he would never forget the people who had believed in him, and one day, he would repay their faith in full."
28/03/2025 14:44:03,Yes,doctor_shadow,Yes,Kosta Aionios Konstantinos,27,Male,Portus Region,Portus Region,Community,,"Kosta Aionios Konstantinos was born in the Filadan Conclave—a rugged, forest-shrouded region tucked into the eastern edge of the planet, hidden by towering mountains and time. Deep within its valleys lies Filada, the cultural heart of the Hellenic community. A place of enduring language, ritual, and civic philosophy, Filada is where tradition and modernity coexist—not always peacefully, but always purposefully.

Kosta grew up surrounded by the pulse of that world. Public discourse wasn’t reserved for institutions—it happened in courtyards, markets, temples, and over shared meals. His mother, a mediator and oral historian, was known for resolving disputes before they reached the council floor. His father, a civic planner, worked tirelessly to balance modern development with community-first values. From them, Kosta inherited both the love of heritage and the discipline to carry it forward.

By 17, he led the Hellenic Youth Forum of Filada. At 20, he took a seat on the local Hellenic council. And at 23, based on his rising expertise in social systems and civil integration, he was appointed as a MP to the Parliament of Novum Domitros.

Kosta joined the Polaris Association, drawn by its commitment to civil liberties, social equity, and quality of life reforms. But inside, he found a party struggling—fractured leadership, splintered ideology, and a widening disconnect between its message and the communities it claimed to serve.

Rather than leave, Kosta went to work.

Through relentless dialogue, restructuring efforts, and an unwavering focus on grounding policy in lived experience, he helped unify the party. Within three years, he emerged as its new leader—not through charisma alone, but by proving that principles, when acted upon, could still move institutions.

At 26, Kosta Aionios Konstantinos was confirmed as Prime Minister of Novum Domitros—the youngest in its history. Now halfway through his first term, he governs with quiet force: expanding protections, building access, and holding fast to the belief that a nation’s strength is measured by how it serves its people.

Still, no matter how far his reach extends, Filada remains home. Kosta returns often—not for politics, but to listen. To sit under the same stone colonnades where his voice first found conviction. To remind himself that leadership begins in the community—and never above it."
28/03/2025 18:32:02,Yes,Romulus15,Yes,Cain Ravenshade,39,Male,Trinus Point Region,Harena Region,Judicial,,"Cain’s mother, Lilith Ravenshade, was a high-ranking member of the family, known for her ruthless cunning. His father, Roderick Ravenshade, had been a feared enforcer in the family’s operations, a man of few words and an iron fist. However, Cain was always different. He always displayed an intellectual rigor that distanced him from the violent tendencies of his kin. While his relatives schemed and fought for power, Cain focused on understanding the inner workings of the galaxy’s politics and the fall of civilizations around him.

Cain left his family behind and found refuge in a small settlement, where he met a former Politian who became his mentor. His mentor began teaching him the art of negotiation and governance. Under their tutelage, Cain began to hone his skills in diplomacy, gaining a reputation as a brilliant strategist who could bring opposing factions to the table"
29/03/2025 04:01:27,Yes,hellbringersbrother,Yes,Franky Fezboar,58,Other,North Lacus Region,Portus Region,Vocational,,"Alright, so you wanna know my history and such? I was born in Stella City, got my first job at when I was 14 or so. I was working at this fancy pizza joint or something, had Freddy in the name. I was a entertainer at this joint, they got all the entertainers in these fancy big costumes. Mine was a animal of some kind. Suits were heavy but had these steam powered joints and stuff to help you move in em. Job was pretty sweet until some kid got mauled pretty bad by the suit locking up with them still inside. Closed the place down in the backlash from that one. 

Now you'd think, knowing that could've happened to me at any time, that I would stay away from dangerous activities for the rest of my life, and while that was true for my co-workers, I, I found it was a bit of a thrill really. It was a high unlike any I had felt before and I wanted more of it. This got me in a spot of bother with the law when I was 18 after I had trespassed onto a waste disposal business and picked a fight with one of the managers. Got laid out by his mates for that one, and got a court case for trespassing to boot. The judge gave me a light sentence where I had to work for that waste disposal business. I ended up being assigned to the manager I picked a fight with, and as it turns out, it was the best decision I could've gotten.

Now, this sentence turned my life around.  My manager wanted me dead, so I got the worst and most dangerous jobs he could find. Unfortunately, for him, all it did was feed the high. He got me collecting waste in the most dangerous parts of Stella City, where people would kill ya for looking at them funny. I had to drive around, pick up rubbish, often scraping hazardous materials by hand into the bins, and avoid pissing off the locals. I loved it so much that when my sentence was done I went and asked him for more work. He saw someone willing to do work no one else wanted and he agreed. 

By my mid 20s I had built quite the reputation but I wanted to do something more for Stella City than just picking up rubbish. I decided to become a civil engineer. Before I left the business, I made sure to find individuals like myself and teach them tricks I learned to work the routes I was rostered to, as a thank you to my manager.

After I finished my training in civil engineering, I managed to use my connections and reputation to get a job in the Portus Region Local government as a civil engineer. For 15 years I managed projects, trained up staff and brought infrastructure in the regions worst areas up to the region's average infrastructure level, no matter the funding we had or the enviornment we were in. I was noticed and snapped up by the Union Government to do much the same country wide. My job now is to travel to the worst parts of the country, assess and fix problems with the infrastructure. My speciality is Hazardous environments. I have fixed pipelines in the deep seas, power grids in space, and protected roads from active volcanoes. I will do as the Union asks, for a better future.

My parents own a successful accounting firm, but I've always loved helping out my grandparents in their construction business. As a pre-teen I found that I loved to fight. My parents got me fighting lessons at the age of 12 to stop me from getting in trouble, which quickly became a passion of mine. Whenever I wasn't working with my grandparents, I was at classes, learning how to fight. I was soon the best in my class, so I started learning other fighting styles and how to fight with a sword. At the age of 18, after I series of robberies in my local area, my parents encouraged me to start my own class, where I can teach self-defence lessons to anyone that shows up. I listened to their wise encouragements and am proud to say that many people have said they've left my classes feeling self-assured, and that my lessons have worked in real life rather than just in training scenarios. If my application is successful, I would diligently complete all duties given to me, whilst still making time to teach the self-defence lessons and occasionally help out my grandparents."
29/03/2025 10:57:19,Yes,cam_nz,Yes,Cam Nullius,32,Male,Visus Primus Region,Terra Cibus Region,Media,,"Cam Nullius spent his childhood and formative years in the western regions of Novum Domitros in the city of Visus Primus. 

Having grown fond of journalism and investigative stories at a younger age, Cam completed work experience at Visus Primus' local media outlet, Channel 39. After a year of internship, he was offered a job at the channel as a junior journalist but declined. Instead, Cam ventured into the study of media at the Moni School of Media and Design in Ventus on the Yark Peninsula.

After four years of successful study, Cam wrote a now influential and awarded research paper on political journalism and its impact on a functioning democracy. It was at the closure of his study that he ventured into political prime-time shows on Channel 39, being offered the position of senior political reporter and later, Chief Political Correspondent. 

Cam would move to Novum Centrum, the Capital City, to fulfil his new role. After several years of popular and influential news, Cam would be asked by the Nexis Media Group to host a new prime-time political and current affairs show, One News. 

After consistently drawing in audiences that placed One News third on the Union Audience Ratings Review, Cam took a more junior role at the media outlet, bought a house in the Terra Cibus region, and accepted an invitation of the Oversight Council to join the Novum Domitros Parliament. Cam would join Parliament in March/April 980 as a technocrat in the media landscape."
29/03/2025 11:25:09,Yes,guardianofthecosmos,Yes,Georgios Papadopoulos,45,Male,Portus Region,Portus Region,Judicial,,"Georgios Papadopoulos was born in the eastern reaches of the Filadan Conclave, where the mountains bite into the sky and the old ways still hold firm. His roots lie in Filada, the Hellenic stronghold tucked deep within the forested valleys—a place of memory, duty, and unwavering structure. But if others in Filada found their calling in dialogue or ritual, Georgios was shaped by discipline.

The son of a decorated police officer and a lawyer, Georgios was raised in a household of precision. His father believed in service through strength; his mother, in justice through order. The values etched into their home were clear: follow the law, respect the chain of command, and never let chaos in through the cracks.

While many of his peers joined youth forums and cultural cooperatives, Georgios took a different path. At 16, he enrolled in the Conclave’s cadet program. At 18, he left Filada for the capital to study law—earning a reputation early on for his sharp mind, iron discipline, and refusal to yield to sentiment. His thesis on ""Order as a Pillar of Democratic Integrity"" still circulates in legal circles today.

Over the next decade, Georgios climbed through the ranks of civil prosecution and judicial advisory roles. His career was marked by tough decisions and tougher stances—earning both respect and fear in equal measure. He became known as a man who did not bend, especially when it came to internal threats, corruption, or the erosion of institutional trust.

His alignment with the Prosperity Party was inevitable. Its core tenets—stability, preservation of the status quo, national strength through law and security—echoed his own philosophy. Under his leadership, the party evolved into a more focused, formidable force: championing increased support for the NDEF, expanded police infrastructure, and tighter legal frameworks to “shield the Republic from disintegration within.”

Though seen by many as an unyielding figure, Georgios is no caricature of authority. He believes, deeply, that order is not oppression—it is protection. And while his methods often clash with more progressive elements, he sees his role as essential: the steady hand that ensures Novum Domitros doesn’t veer off the cliff of instability.

Appointed as Attorney General under Kosta Konstantinos’ cabinet, Georgios' presence is a statement in itself: even amidst reform, the foundations must hold.

He still returns to Filada—though rarely, and never for ceremony. When he visits, it’s to walk the old mountain paths in silence, or to sit at the base of the stone memorial his father helped build. Not for reflection, but reminder."
29/03/2025 12:10:20,Yes,bassthefrog,Yes,Bas ton vátracho,30,Male,Portus Region,Novum Centrum Region,Media,,"They used to call him “that frog guy with a mic.” Now they call him Member Vátracho.

Bas ton Vátracho, 30, of the Hellenic community in the Filadan Concave, wasn’t born into power—he broadcasted his way into it. From his first pirate radio stream out of a cramped tower flat in Southern Filadan to becoming one of the most-watched independent journalists in the system, Bas built a legacy not through politics, but platforms.

Unapologetically eccentric, deeply principled, and always online, Bas made his name uncovering corporate coverups, cultural erasure, and the voices buried beneath bureaucracy. He mixed Hellenic folk tunes with digital protest art, gave voice to street-level resistance, and wrapped hard truths in biting satire.

Now a Member of Parliament, Bas stands among academics—not to govern, but to advise, challenge, and shape policy from the lens of communication. He doesn’t hold executive power, but his words can tilt public perception faster than most ministers can draft a bill.

He still signs off his streams the same way he always has:

“Truth ripples. Even in a still pond.”"

While others played outside, Alexios sat at the counter, balancing receipts and calculating margins. He was never loud, never showy—just precise.

He studied finance not for power, but for understanding. To him, every dollar spent told a story. After years working in local co-ops and helping small businesses navigate tricky economic cycles, he caught the attention of the Parliament. Alexios was nominated—not for political ambition, but because people trusted his judgment.

Now a Member of Parliament, Alexios quietly reviews budgets, monitors economic policies, and advocates for transparency and fairness. He speaks plainly, keeps to himself, and still does his own calculations by hand—just to be sure.

He’s not famous. He’s not flashy. But when someone needs the truth behind the numbers, they turn to Alexios."
